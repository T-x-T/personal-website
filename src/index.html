<p>Hello there! On the internet I call myself TxT or often TheTxT or some variant thereof (please be smarter at picking names than me).</p>
<p>This is my little space on the world wide web, with a <a href="/blog">blog</a>, a list of my current <a href="/projects">projects</a> and some more information <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>

<p><b>tech:</b> rust with actix-web on the backend, nuxtjs on the frontend</p>
<p><a href="https://dukatia.com" target="_blank">Dukatia</a> is a personal finance manager I have been working on since about 3 years.</p>
<p>It is still far from done, although I already did release a 1.0 version.</p>
<p>The idea to work on it came to me because I really needed to replace an old excel sheet I used to use for managing my finances as it grew out of control.</p>
<p>I also documented part of the development process <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am--bDrc2o4&list=PLht_DnAZ_Av4MoGbcPm0I140PrOe9Yw24" target="_blank">in a series of Youtube videos</a>.</p>
