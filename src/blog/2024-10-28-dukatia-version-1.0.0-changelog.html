		<p>Hello there!<br />
		Exactly 3 years ago I created the first commit for my new project called TxT's Treasury. Since then a lot has happened. A change to a better name, a complete rewrite of the backend from Typescript to Rust and an update of the frontend from Nuxt v2 to v3. About 2.5 years ago I started using Dukatia myself to replace my old Excel sheet that I used to keep track of my finances.  <br />
		I think it goes without saying that I learned a lot during development so far. This definitely will not stop. Im already thinking about Dukatia v2.  <br />
		Also make sure to check out the <a href="https://dukatia.com">Dukatia website</a>! Over there you will find the documentation and also a link to the live demo.</p>
		<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
		<p>I have a lot of ideas for new features that I still want to implement. Before I'm starting on that I will redo the frontend using HTMX. For that I'm also planning on building my own HTML renderer in Rust. The goal is that Dukatia will then be able to deployed as a single binary that contains the frontend and backend. Of course this wouldn't be the best use of time if my plan was to build a real product, but as a learning exercise it sounds quite interesting to me.  <br />
		I'm also thinking about implementing support for sqlite. For the purposes of Dukatia it should be fast enough. The ease of use from having just a single db file also sounds quite compelling. This would allow you to deploy, run and backup your Dukatia instance from just a single folder.  <br />
		I also want to reactivate my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheTxT">YouTube channel</a>. On there I made a video about building a custom Minecraft server in Rust. I definitely want to continue this series now that I have some more time on my hands again.</p>
		<h2 id="updating">Updating</h2>
		<p>Updating to this new release should be as simple as pulling the new docker images, if you are using the main tag.</p>
		<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
		<p>I only swapped out the beta logo for the regular one.</p>
