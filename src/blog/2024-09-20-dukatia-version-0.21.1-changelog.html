<div id="content"><p>Hello there!<br />
	After getting the <a href="https://dukatia.com/demo">public demo</a> online, I could get back to fixing some more small issues and some little improvements.</p>
	<h2 id="updating">Updating</h2>
	<p>Updating to this new release should be as simple as pulling the new docker images, if you are using the main tag.</p>
	<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
	<p>All the issues closed can be found on Github in the <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/milestone/15?closed=1">0.21.1 milestone</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The account and recipient fields of new transactions now get automatically populated based on table filters  <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/97">#97</a></li>
	<li>The settings page now shows information about the current build like version, branch and commit sha <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/102">#102</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Cant edit total on asset buy/sell with transaction form <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/98">#98</a></li>
	<li>Fix Github action warnings <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/101">#101</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="road-to-100">Road to 1.0.0</h2>
	<p>There are still some more little things that I want to implement and some more testing that needs to take place before I can release 1.0.0. The first commit for Dukatia was made on October 28th 2021, so I am currently planning on releasing 1.0.0 exactly three years later on October 28th 2024. It is of course not 100% fixed, especially because the new <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418">Factorio expansion</a> will release one week earlier!</p></div>
