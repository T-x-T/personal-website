		<p>Hello there!<br />
		This is yet another small release to fix even more small issues and improve some things. The features I'm most happy with is probably the redesigned login page. Can you guess where I took that background photo?</p>
		<h2 id="updating">Updating</h2>
		<p>Updating to this new release should be as simple as pulling the new docker images, if you are using the main tag.</p>
		<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
		<p>All the issues closed can be found on Github in the <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/milestone/16?closed=1">0.21.2 milestone</a>.</p>
		<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>add option start at zero to charts  <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/99">#99</a></li>
		<li>Improve settings page on mobile <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/104">#104</a></li>
		<li>enhance login page design <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/103">#103</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>modifying chart creates new chart instead of modifying it</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="road-to-100">Road to 1.0.0</h2>
		<p>There are still some more little things that I want to implement and some more testing that needs to take place before I can release 1.0.0. The first commit for Dukatia was made on October 28th 2021, so I am currently planning on releasing 1.0.0 exactly three years later on October 28th 2024. It is of course not 100% fixed, especially because the new <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418">Factorio expansion</a> will release one week earlier!</p>
