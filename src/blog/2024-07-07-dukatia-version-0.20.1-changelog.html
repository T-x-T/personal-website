	<p>Well hello! This is something new I'm trying to do now for every Dukatia version I release: A blog post talking more in depth about the changes.<br />
		Version 0.20.1 is just a minor patch release containing a couple of fixes, mostly around UI problems in the frontend.<br />
		Dukatia is now moving closer to the 1.0.0 release, so I'm mostly just tying up loose ends. The next release is going to be 0.21.0 which will turn into 1.0.0, according to my current plan at least.</p>
		<h2 id="updating">Updating</h2>
		<p>Updating to this new release should be as simple as pulling the new docker images, if you are using the main tag.</p>
		<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
		<p>All the issues closed can be found on Github in the <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/milestone/13?closed=1">0.20.1 milestone</a>.</p>
		<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
		<p>There was one enhancement:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/80">Set title in browser tab #80</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>
		<p>I fixed quite a few small bugs, mostly around UI issues in the frontend:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/78">Headers overlapping when resizing window #78</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/79">Last Month Daterange in charts buggy #79</a></li>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/88">currency symbol in transaction form doesnt update with account #88</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/87">Numbers between 0 and 1 are marked blue in tables #87</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/77">Gap after headers when resizing window to a smaller size without sidebar #77</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/85">Collapsing the sidebar could only should the symbol without the text, since with text with looks a bit small #85</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/84">Changing the password for the current user won't give you an message that it changed successfully #84</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues/83">When resetting password from current logged in user, dukatia says that i cant disable myself #83</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/bengiv">@bengiv</a> for reporting some of these.</p>
		<h2 id="road-to-100">Road to 1.0.0</h2>
		<p>This release marked another important step towards the release of version 1.0.0 which will hopefully happen in July or August this year. Apart from polishing Dukatia itself, there is also another important thing that needs to be done: The Dukatia website. You can try out the current beta version of the site <a href="https://dukatia.pages.dev/">here</a>.<br />
		The main thing I'm still working on over there is the documentation, which isn't the most fun thing in the world to create. However, going through the project from the angle of writing documentation also uncovered some inconsistencies. So it is definitely helpful, even at increasing the code and API quality.</p>
