<p>Hello there! On the internet I call myself TxT or often TheTxT or some variant thereof (please be smarter at picking names than me).</p>
<p>In my free time I like to create software that I would want to use myself. I also love playing around with server and linux stuff, which is why I work as an IT Systems administrator.</p>
<p>My code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/T-x-T" target="_blank">github</a> profile. You can also contact me via <a href="mailto:blog@thetxt.io">email</a> or chat with on discord where I go by @thetxt.</p>
